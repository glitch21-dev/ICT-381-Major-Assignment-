**ICT-381 MAJOR ASSIGNMENT SUBMISSION**
### Project Scope Summary — Group 16


This project was carried out in two main phases over two weeks, focusing on the design and documentation of the assigned system.

**Week 1 — Requirements Gathering & Analysis**
During the first week, Group 16 successfully identified all relevant stakeholders and clearly defined the problem statement and project goals. Both functional and non-functional requirements were gathered and documented, each mapped to well-defined user stories following the *“As a … I want … so that …”* format, along with acceptance criteria. The team also identified key assumptions, constraints, and potential risks that could affect project delivery. An initial domain glossary was prepared to establish a common understanding of system terminology.

A concise vision summary was created to capture the overall purpose and direction of the project. Each requirement was prioritized using *Must*, *Should*, and *Could* tags to guide development focus. A context diagram was produced to illustrate the relationship between the system and its external actors. Additionally, a draft backlog was developed in preparation for Week 2 activities. The week concluded with a PowerPoint presentation showcasing the team’s analysis and findings.

**Week 2 — Use Case & Sequence Diagrams**
In the second week, Group 16 analyzed the user stories to identify the system’s primary actors and core use cases. Detailed use case specifications were written, including the name, primary actor, stakeholders, preconditions, triggers, main success flow, alternate/exception flows, postconditions, and success guarantees.

A comprehensive Use Case Diagram was developed to visualize system interactions, accompanied by 3–6 fully documented use case specifications. For critical scenarios, 2–3 UML Sequence Diagrams were created to demonstrate message passing, lifelines, activation bars, and conditional flows (alt/opt fragments) aligned with the MVC architecture.

The week concluded with a PowerPoint demonstration summarizing the team’s use case analysis and sequence diagram designs, effectively showcasing the progress and deliverables of Group 16.
